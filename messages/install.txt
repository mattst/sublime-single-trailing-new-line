        Single Trailing Newline - Package for Sublime Text
        --------------------------------------------------

Thank you for installing the Single Trailing Newline package.

This Sublime Text package makes sure that there is exactly one trailing newline
at the end of a file.

All the whitespace and trailing newlines at the end of the file, if there are
any, are removed and a single newline is inserted.

Empty files (a file size of zero) are deliberately ignored and will not have a
newline inserted into them.

The plugin has been designed to run automatically every time a file is saved,
either for all files or for only files with the syntaxes that you specify. This
will only start happening if you enable the plugin for all syntaxes or add one
or more syntaxes that you want to trigger the plugin (see the documentation).

Palette commands are provided to run the plugin and to change its settings;
adding/removing syntaxes that will trigger the plugin, and to allow or prevent
the plugin from working with all syntaxes.

No keymap file is provided but any users who would prefer to run the plugin
manually, on an as-needed basis, can setup a key binding to do so easily (see
the documentation).
